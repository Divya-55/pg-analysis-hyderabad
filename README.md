# PG Rental Insights â€“ Hyderabad

## Problem Statement
To analyze PG (Paying Guest) rental data in Hyderabad and identify:
- Pricing patterns (rent vs. deposit)  
- Occupancy trends (single, double, triple, 4-sharing)  
- Facility & amenity distributions  
- Availability timelines  

This helps **students, working professionals, and property owners** make informed decisions about accommodation and investments.

## Dataset
- **File:** `final_pg_data.csv`  
- **Source:** PG accommodation listings (synthetic/collected dataset)  
- **Features include:**  
  - Location  
  - Occupancy type  
  - Rent & Deposit  
  - Amenities  
  - Food availability  
  - Availability dates  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards & visuals  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

---

## Approach & Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Extracted amenities from string format  
   - Converted dates to datetime format  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Rent & deposit distributions  
   - Location-wise price trends  
   - Occupancy vs. affordability  

3. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   Created visuals to highlight insights:  
   - **Occupancy Type Distribution** â†’ 4-sharing most popular  
   - **Average Rent vs. Deposit by Location** â†’ Banjara Hills highest rent  
   - **Food Facility Availability** â†’ 92% provide full meals  
   - **Upcoming PG Availability** â†’ Spike at beginning of the month  
   - **Room Amenities Distribution** â†’ Beds & fans common, AC/geysers rare  
   - **Heatmap of Average Rents & Returns** â†’ Premium vs. budget areas  

---

## Key Insights
- **Affordability dominates:** 4-sharing PGs are most common.  
- **Location premium:** Banjara Hills, Madhapur, and Gachibowli have higher rents.  
- **Hidden costs:** Some areas (e.g., Kondapur, Begumpet) demand high deposits despite moderate rents.  
- **Convenience factor:** Food facility is almost standard in Hyderabad PGs.  
- **Seasonal availability:** PGs often list new availability at the beginning of the month.
